# Music Tagger
Correctly tag your music files

Do you have a lot of music files with incorrect or no tags? Manually correcting these tags can be a painful thing to do. This project is meant to make that process less painful.

(Yes, the UI could use a bit of work)

This app is built with Electron.

## Usage
* First load the folder with your .mp3 files using the "Load Folder" button.
* Once a song shows up in the current panel, type the name of the song in the "Song Name" field, and then wait for an image to show up in the fetched panel.
* If you are satisfied with the results, hit the "Update Tags" button.
* If you are not satisfied with the results, hit the "Next" button at the top to fetch the next result, or previous for the previous result.
* If you need help identifying the current song, hit the "Play Song" button, and if you still can't identify the song, Shazam is your friend.
* To move on to the next song in your library, use the "Next =>" button on the bottom. 

Have fun!
